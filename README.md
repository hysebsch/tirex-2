This repository provides the pre-trained multivariate forecasting model TiRex-2 introduced in the paper [TiRex-2: Generalizing TiRex to Multivariate Data and Streaming](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2607.01204).

> **TiRex-2 Pro:** This repository is our open-source release. Our pro version extends TiRex-2 with streaming, hardware-optimized inference (edge, embedded, and industrial PCs, among others), finetuning, and classification & regression support — see [TiRex-2 Pro](#tirex-2-pro) below or contact us at [contact@nx-ai.com](mailto:contact@nx-ai.com).

## TiRex-2

TiRex-2 is a **pretrained time series foundation model** that forecasts one or many target
variates directly from their history, optionally conditioned on past and future-known
covariates. A single checkpoint serves both univariate and multivariate forecasting, built
on a recurrent architecture designed for efficient streaming settings — all zero-shot, with
no task-specific training or fine-tuning.

TiRex-2 generalizes our original univariate model, [TiRex](https://github.com/NX-AI/tirex), to
multivariate forecasting with past and future covariates.

## Key facts

- **Zero-shot multivariate forecasting**:
  TiRex-2 forecasts multiple target variates out of the box, without training or fine-tuning on your data.

- **Past and future-known covariates**:
  TiRex-2 natively conditions on past covariates and future-known covariates, such as
  calendar features, holidays, promotions, or scheduled interventions.

- **Small active footprint**:
  TiRex-2 activates 38.4M parameters in univariate mode and an additional 44.1M parameters
  for multivariate forecasting.

## Installation
### Via Pip
```bash
pip install tirex-2
```

Install with additional dependencies:

```bash
pip install "tirex-2[examples,fev,gluonts]"
```

The Python package installation is currently only tested on Linux and macOS. Docker usage is documented separately and includes Linux, macOS, and Windows Docker Desktop instructions.

### Development setup with uv

We use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for development. Install uv, then run:

```bash
make install        # auto-detects GPU and installs the right torch variant
make test           # run the test suite
```

On a CUDA-capable machine this installs PyTorch built with CUDA 12.8 (`cu128`), which is the version the upstream xlstm/FlashRNN CUDA extensions are tested against. If you are on a DGX Spark or similar machine with a CUDA 13.0 driver, the Makefile will download a local CUDA 12.8 toolkit so the extensions can be compiled against the matching CUDA version (CUDA 13 drivers are backward compatible with CUDA 12.8 binaries).

Common Makefile targets:

```bash
make minimal        # sine-wave smoke example
make comparison     # covariate demo
make fevbench       # fev-bench runner
make gifteval       # GiftEval runner
make notebook       # launch Jupyter Lab
make lint           # ruff check
make format         # ruff format
```

## Getting started

The most easy way for you to get started is by checking out our ["Getting Started" notebook](examples/getting_started.ipynb). Moreover, you can jump straight into testing out TiRex using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/NX-AI/tirex-2/blob/main/examples/getting_started.ipynb). If you have cloned this repository, start the notebook with:

```bash
make notebook
```

### Minimal usage predicting a simple sine wave
```python
import torch
from tirex2 import TimeseriesType, load_model
from tirex2.plotting import plot_multivariate  # requires matplotlib to be installed

# load model
model = load_model("NX-AI/TiRex-2", device="cpu")  # use `device="cuda"` if cuda is available

# generate data - target expects time series of shape (n_targets, context_length)
context = torch.sin(torch.arange(128).float() / 8)
ts = TimeseriesType(target=context.unsqueeze(0), past_covariates=None, future_covariates=None)

# perform forecast - each forecast is of shape (n_targets, 9 quantiles, prediction_length)
forecast = model.forecast([ts], prediction_length=32, output_type="numpy")[0]

# visualize result
fig = plot_multivariate(ts, forecast, engine="matplotlib")
fig.show()
```

### Covariate example
This example originates from the "Getting Started" notebook, showing the value of additional covariates.
```python
from tirex2 import load_model
from tirex2.demo import Demo, plot_demo_forecast

# load model
model = load_model("NX-AI/TiRex-2", device="cpu")  # use `device="cuda"` if cuda is available

# load data
demo = Demo.create_nonstationary_demo()
ts_univariate = demo.to_timeseries_type(include_covariates=False)
ts_multivariate = demo.to_timeseries_type(include_covariates=True)

# perform forecast - each forecast is of shape (n_targets, 9 quantiles, prediction_length)
forecasts = model.forecast(
    timeseries=[ts_univariate, ts_multivariate],
    prediction_length=demo.horizon,
    output_type="numpy",
)

# visualize result
fig = plot_demo_forecast(demo, *forecasts, engine="matplotlib")
fig.show()
```

### Benchmarking
To reproduce our results for the [GIFT-Eval](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Salesforce/GIFT-Eval) and [fev-bench](https://huggingface.co/spaces/autogluon/fev-bench) leaderboards, follow the instructions in
[/examples/gifteval/](./examples/gifteval/README.md) and [/examples/fevbench/](./examples/fevbench/README.md), respectively.

## TiRex Docker image

For detailed instructions on building and running TiRex-2 in a Docker container, see the [Docker README](./inference/README.md).

## Training and fine-tuning

This repository includes experimental training and fine-tuning support under `tirex2.pro`:

```python
from tirex2.pro.finetuning import FineTuner

fine_tuner = FineTuner(model, strategy="head-only")  # or "full", "blocks", "lora"
fine_tuner.fit(
    train_data,           # list of TimeseriesType or TiRexDataset
    val_data=None,
    epochs=10,
    batch_size=8,
    learning_rate=1e-4,
    output_dir="./checkpoints",
)
fine_tuner.save("./fine_tuned_model")
```

Strategies:

- `full` — update all model parameters.
- `head-only` — freeze the multivariate stack and train the input/output embeddings (fastest, recommended for domain adaptation).
- `blocks` — train only selected stack blocks, e.g. `strategy_kwargs={"blocks_to_train": [10, 11]}`.
- `lora` — inject low-rank adapters into the variate-mixer attention and train only the adapter weights.

The training objective is the pinball (quantile) loss from the paper, applied at every observed output time step. A `SyntheticCouplingPipeline` can generate multivariate training samples from a pool of univariate series, mirroring the data-augmentation approach described in Section 3.4.

A command-line training script is available:

```bash
python scripts/train.py --config configs/finetune.yaml --ckpt NX-AI/TiRex-2 --out ./checkpoints
```

## TiRex-2 Pro
TiRex-2 already provides state-of-the-art performance for zero-shot prediction, so you can use this open-source release without training on your own data.

Our pro version extends TiRex-2 with additional capabilities, including:

- **Streaming**: incremental forecast updates as new observations arrive, without recomputing over the full history.
- **Speed**: performance-optimized inference, including optimization for dedicated hardware such as edge, embedded, and industrial PC deployments.
- **Finetuning**: models fine-tuned on your data or with different pretraining.
- **Classification & Regression**: TiRex-2 adapted for classification and regression tasks.
